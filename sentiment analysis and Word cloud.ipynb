       "['✅ trip verified |  my daughter and i were denied boarding on our business class flight from madrid to heathrow in march 25, 2023, the first leg on our return flight to victoria, canada. no reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the british airways counter in madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to call british airways. we were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. after many tries we finally reached british airways by phone, but we were told to call expedia which had booked the flights. expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both expedia and british airways. incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on april 3. this was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. even though these were business class tickets. part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. this nine day delay was a major problem for us. i had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. further, we received no compensation from british airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. after our return i began the british airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. i received an email reply and a case reference number. and then nothing. i sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. it is now months later, and still i have not heard from british airways. this is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service i have received for my thousands of flights over many decades. i am a very patient person and this is the first time i have commented on this type of forum. i think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at british airways.',\n",

       " '✅ trip verified |  british airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. i was booked to fly from frankfurt main to london city airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by ba without explanation, when i was already at the airport. the worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. the ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not ba employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact ba directly via phone if we wanted help. they couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! so ba abandoned its passengers. they did tell us that the ba departure to heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further ba flight from frankfurt to london that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but ba refused to rebook us on them). the reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. no assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. i received an email an hour later notifying me that i had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as i had to get back to london that night. i rang ba’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. there was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and i had a solid phone signal and wifi as i was still standing in terminal 2 of frankfurt main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. they just don’t care. in the end i had to arrange my own return to london by taking a coach to hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with ryanair to stansted. at least that flight operated on time and got me back to london! ba is worse than a low cost carrier now.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified | london heathrow to keflavik, iceland in business class on an a321. british airways provides an unusual business class experience for intra-europe flights. the seating is similar to most airlines - middle seat vacant and little extra space - but on british airways the business class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft. this makes it less than a premium experience at every step, from boarding to onboard. the wifi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds. but when it worked it was surprisingly fast. service on this flight was very good and we got to keflavik on time.',\n",

       " '✅ trip verified |  flying a380 business class should be a pleasure but ba has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable. how could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. the tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. there is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . the window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. the whole business class set up is a sick joke. eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off. are there any redeeming features - the answer is no. if you like a little comfort avoid ba like the plague.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  british airways absolutely does not care. my reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight, full flight and it was quite awful. after enquiring at lax check in, the agent said sorry, nothing we can do. onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed, with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice. then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that. no water runs, if you need anything do not bother with the call bell, as they simply ignore it. i used to like travelling british airways 10-15 years ago, but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier. i guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service. my last trip to london was with delta, they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that british air has now become.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  my recent experience with british airways was not just horrendous, it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part. i arrived at jfk ready for my flight to malaga, only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice. after a draining 2-hour altercation, i was finally placed on a different flight. the nightmare continued when i landed in malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son\\'s wedding. thirty agonizing hours later, the bags showed up—but my brand-new ipad and a special watch for my nephew were missing. the items weren\\'t merely valuable; they had emotional significance, which made the loss even more gut-wrenching. you\\'d think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors.  despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit. their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. their response was, in essence, \"it\\'s your fault for trusting us with your belongings.\" this isn\\'t just poor customer service; it\\'s a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility. british airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to. if you have any respect for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid british airways at all costs. they not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err, leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence.',\n",

       " '✅ trip verified | terrible experience with british airways. i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may 10, 2023. my flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin\\'s place. en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure, i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight, so it was imperative that i got to london. i checked the ba website and couldn\\'t find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund. i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after 10:00 p.m. so i booked that and then called british airways as i wanted to discuss compensation. that\\'s when they advised me that because i had requested a refund (they used the phrase \"abandoned\" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. apparently, i should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. of course they don\\'t explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. once this incident happened, i ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to london from malaga (i.e., different airport than the one i had originally booked from). and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived, i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i couldn\\'t travel by train to my cousin\\'s place any longer (3 bags in tow) and i didn\\'t want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. this cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn\\'t budge. very easy for them to say what i should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren\\'t the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. i\\'ve been an executive club member for years and they simply didn\\'t care. they said there was nothing they could do. i\\'m sure if one of the ba executive\\'s friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. i used to be a fan of ba but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit, i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again.',\n",

       " \"✅ trip verified |  \\r\\nour flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from london gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. i understand why the likes of easyjet, ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. outbound lgw-dbv: boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots. aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. inbound dbv-lgw: for some reason no online or app check-in available, despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. no queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. it's truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! no apology for delay. cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones ba are installing from row 14 onwards. these seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. we landed 55 minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. we'd spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly ba as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.\",\n",

       " '✅ trip verified | probably the worst business class experience i\\'ve ever had on an airline. just a few of the issues: required to purchase seats on international (club world) business class. this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (lhr-lax) for a family of four. given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. on my vie-lhr leg, the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow. boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (i have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380, and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered. online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. i was urged repeatedly (on the ba website, and via email and text) to \"upload my covid documents\" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no covid documents required for travel. after i filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any \"covid documentation\" - i was informed (several hours later) that my \"covid documents have been verified\". i then received another text message urging me to \"upload my covid documentation\". on the vie-lhr leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. that said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. terrible, one might say. on the lhr-lax leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were no mid-flight beverage services at all. unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the \"chicken or fish?\" type of meal selection similar to economy class. there was no coffee or tea service after meals. food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a \"ploughman\\'s lunch\" being downright disgusting. . there was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. i won\\'t comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. the seats are not 6\\' 2\" long as stated on the ba website, and i found the seats too short for my 6\\' 2\" height. the \"priority\" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.',\n",

       " '✅ trip verified |  overall, a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays. lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when i travelled last time). although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23c) and had a funky lighting. although seats are the same as those in economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at air france) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for gold card passengers, ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch). the crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. i am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. for a quick hop, ba ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a cdg-lhr leg air france presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box). one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5: the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead. it’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a gold status. nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. the flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.',\n",

       " '✅ trip verified |  toronto to geneva via london. i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. apparently things have improved somewhat since, so i decided to give them another try. overall, i was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. on the plus side: i flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31\". pilots were very good and informative, as always with ba. quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; i rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. the ife was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. cathay pacific\\'s is far superior. the two major downsides: 1. the new basic economy fare. it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. ba really need to get rid of it. virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. if i wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, i\\'d fly to gatwick on a charter airline. also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely. 2. no complimentary catering on short-haul. seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with ba and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. if ba would get rid of these two new features, i would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. as it is, i would still consider other airlines.',\n",

       " \"✅ trip verified |  the first thing is the shortage of staff. the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. at the end of the flight i discovered the switch. despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. i had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack. i am not a big eater but i was peckish. the layout of the business cabin is cramped. i am 6' and i could not stretch out. the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. this means no one has a easy seat. you either have to climb or be climbed over. i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use. the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. unfortunately, upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didn't get any better. after one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing. \",\n",

       " \"not verified |  london to johannesburg. british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. but in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. with that said in 2018, my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october, specifically 10/31. yes, that's the day called for brexit. only we made our reservations before those dates were set. considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september 2019, coupled with brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. the good news is close to $800 in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage. the bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. i was just not feeling the love here! so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways. all of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. instead of ba, we changed our booking to 10/30 on etihad airways through abu dhabi. their customer service was outstanding. the fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other. i am entering travel in september 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware.\",\n",

       " \"✅ trip verified | johannesburg to cape town return. this flight was operated by comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe. check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business. johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. their lounge, called slow is actually impressive. although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. they even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. these seats were old and plush, however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support. i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. there were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. the crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. they were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. in cape town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways, and they were the same price as the competition, south african airways. i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route. for the price paid, i'd be happy to fly them again.\",\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  grenada to gatwick. having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. the cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. the entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! but the family really found them entertaining. for me the real issue was the tight leg room - i am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! it was for me very tight. previously the seat format was 3-3-3. it is now 3-4-3. we were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. we sat in a 2, which was more bearable. i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! despite best efforts to sleep, i failed..... i remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. in summary, it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.\",\n",

(i have flown both in 1st). the food is also business class quality. more casual dining rather than fine dining. taking one meal; it starts with an amuse bouche. one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. one tomato. one bit of green stuff. one straggly piece of prosciutto ham. total cost about 30p. outstanding! i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. totally, utterly boring. my wife had the soup which she said was nice. i then had jerk chicken dish. it was just about okay. the glassware and chinaware was okay. the cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you\\'d expect in pizza express, except the stuff in pizza express is better. i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much ba could do to improve the \"cheap\" look of their premium product. quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. they trumpet the \"superb\" laurent perrier grand siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug. £20 a bottle more! the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang club business class. the world\\'s most hated business class in the sky. i\\'m a businessman and i know i could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. from a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women.',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  moscow to london. fantastic first class service. the moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent runway views. quick boarding, and i was escorted to my seat by the crew. the new first seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. there's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal i've had. drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. the crew were very attentive and friendly with it. a fantastic experience, and i'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  johannesburg to london . for supper i asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as i don\\'t drink tea or coffee for health reasons. given with no problems. for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused. i explained i don\\'t drink tea or coffee but milk and water.\" we don\\'t keep hot water, i can get it once we have finished serving all other customers\". that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger. i kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water, explaining i have been waiting. he said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. i felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  bridgetown to gatwick. booked our return flight in business/club class (at £1,000+ each) only to find ba want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.  awful seating with their ying/yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. poor cabin staff attitude - i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told \"we only do that in first class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that\". i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - this happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. if you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed.',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  glasgow to new york via london. morning flight from gla to lhr was ok. i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk. on the jfk flight the service was fantastic. the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. we left and arrived on time. the seat and legroom was fine. my mothers ife didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. the cabin crew were very friendly.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  sydney to london via singapore. i\\'m hugely disappointed with the business class trip. the seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you\\'re interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. if you\\'re next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. if you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. after i watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. the \"new releases\" is a contradiction in terms. there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. i would not recommend ba to anyone.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  johannesburg to london. in contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. the dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. breakfast was pretty good. arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight.',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  antigua to gatwick. one of the worst business class experience. entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed. woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt. \",\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  gatwick to barbados. first class was third rate. a disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. i have avoided flying with ba for the last 20 years, now i remember why. avoid them if your route allows.\",\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  cape town to london. very unimpressive amenities and service. unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (i gave him one of the two sets on mine). i, on the other hand never got the main course. i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked.\",\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  bucharest to london. they are not giving free food and drinks anymore, you have to pay on short haul. in bucharest they did not park at the terminal, they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus. they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy'. avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to. i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline, but at least charge accordingly, otherwise, it feels like we're being scammed.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified | kuala lumpur to mexico city via london. the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring. however, during my trip from london to mexico city on 2 dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with muslim needs on food. they are polite and talk to me with big smiles. so, when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on 5 dec 2018, i wished i will be able to meet them again. hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  miami to london. ba are going downhill . having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey, the choice was exactly the same this time.  i explained to the steward that i didn’t like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but i was told by an extremely rude steward that i could like it or lump it basically. he said i should have put my requests on my account but you can’t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn’t expect them only to have two menus.  the snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bun. totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worse. the light didn’t work on my seat so i couldn’t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my tv, watching was incredibly hard. entertainment having travelled four times in last month, films have barely changed. i won’t be travelling with them again if at all possible.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified | \\r\\ni would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight, service from the crew and the food served. before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company. overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa.',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified | arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. during this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. despite this, ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements ba's transformation into an overpriced easyjet. will not fly with them again.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  we have been loyal customers with british airways since i was a little girl. every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy. on october 17th i booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october 31st coming back november 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. on october 19th my grandfather passed away. we put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. as british airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. in addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience i’ve ever encountered.  i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future. ',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  gatwick to las vegas. boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best i’ve ever had on a long haul flight. the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days. all in all a very enjoyable flight.',\n",
       " 'not verified |  nassau to london. premium economy on ba is a joke. highlighted by my friday morning 7am breakfast. a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, croissant and an equally sealed banana bread/cake. no hot food/drink; awful. that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in economy. the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. ba premium economy - forget it. other airlines do this better.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  phoenix to accra via london. i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in. she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently. my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well. just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.',\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  manchester to london. the bag drop process took an hour even though i had checked in already. the staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. another flight attendant didn’t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. not exactly best of british, and i’ll certainly not be recommending!',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  san diego to hannover via london. i booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i would miss my flight into london. american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in 3 days. i took the coach and american assured my that ba would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference. a bizarre exchange followed. first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. i told them to look at the ticket. you can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. i contacted ba germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  i booked with ba on their website. they saidthey would send this to london so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight. this is miserable customer service.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  london heathrow to stuttgart. absolutely disgusted with ba. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. ba had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart. this has proven too difficult. the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  london to johannesburg. turning right to the first wing at t5 was a new experience for us. it was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly mr convivial. the concorde room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. boarding involved lining up according to group. this smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but i guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. the first cabin on the a380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. the dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. the wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous lpgs, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. sleep quality was considerably better than club world, although the cabin temperature was a little high. overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  having booked ba business class and paid extra for the seat selection on the boeing 787, i was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. i rejected ba\\'s offer of flying on belgian air and had to change my flight to get a different ba aircraft. when i booked in the window seat selections had been lost. my husband and i were forced to sit separately. at the booking in i was told that they could not find \"proof\" that i had paid for selected seats. i could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip i planned. on the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my tv did not work. the staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seat. on return, ba customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight. despite sending two detailed messages, i received the same response. completely inadequate service by ba (not the flight attendants) in delivering the flights i paid for and dealing with the complaints.',\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  vancouver to london heathrow. i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what i needed. the booking process was not smooth and very stressful, i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. the 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok. the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my baby. i originally wanted a one of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. all the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, i'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant.\",\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  boston to nairobi via london. the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow. the cabin crew service was below standard. i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because i was watching a movie. i  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry. the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from boston to heathrow. it looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a usb port. cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard. i'm probably to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better. \",\n",
       " \"✅ trip verified |  basel to san fransisco via heathrow. i'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a380 and i has reserved an aisle seat. the food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the uk). the flight back to the uk was worse since it was a boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. you couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and i'm not big. the recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. i feel sorry for larger people. the food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. the staff seem challenged with certain situations. next time i'm off to the us i will look for an alternative airline.\",\n",
       " '✅ trip verified |  london to lyon. the flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 1:30. ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and i got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. then the customer service has been very useless. such a very bad experience. i do not recommend flying with them.',\n",
